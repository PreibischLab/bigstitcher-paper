\section{LINKS TO THE CURRENT SOURCE CODES}
\label{sec:currentcode}

BigStitcher can be seen as an extension to the multiview-reconstruction project, but over time, many changes have been pushed upstream and the two projects have evolved in parallel. Both projects are licensed under the GPL(v2) and the source code is freely available on GitHub, at \url{https://github.com/PreibischLab/BigStitcher} and \url{https://github.com/PreibischLab/multiview-reconstruction}, respectively.

The CUDA code for accelerated interest point detection and devonvolution is available from \url{https://github.com/StephanPreibisch/SeparableConvolutionCUDALib} and \url{https://github.com/StephanPreibisch/FourierConvolutionCUDALib}, respectively.

Newer versions will be hosted using GitHub, and release announcements will be done on the GitHub page (\url{https://github.com/PreibischLab/BigStitcher}) and on the ImageJ wiki (\url{http://imagej.net/BigStitcher}). Releases are and will be provided to end users via the Fiji update mechanism. The current version of the user guide (\ref{sec:documentation}) will be hosted on the same wiki page (\url{http://imagej.net/BigStitcher#Documentation}).
